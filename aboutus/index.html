            <p class="Para"> Saavyas'19 is to be the second edition of the annual 
                inter-college techno-cultural fest of National Institute of Technology Goa. It will be a three-day 
                event involving technical, music, arts, dance and drama enthusiasts from all over the country through 
                competitions and performances. The name Saavyas finds its roots in a Sanskrit word meaning ‘bringing 
                people together’. We believe that Saavyas will be the perfect festival to bring both technology and 
                culture together on one platform.<br><br><br><br><br> </p>
